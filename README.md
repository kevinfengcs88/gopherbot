# gopherbot

is emu, but in gopher form

### TODO

- Add !logs command to allow users to view SOTF dedicated server logs
    - If output is too long, send as a .txt file
    - Allow user to enter parameters representing how many lines back they want to see
    - Set a toggle for the SOTF DS logs so that the bot automatically spits out the output when toggle is on
- Print out help message with triple backticks to code format it
